HOW TO RUN UNITTEST
===================
1. go to target folder (e.g for mkckks "cd mkckks")
2. run go test command "go test -args -n=x" (x is the number of parties e.g for 2 parites set x to 2)


HOW TO RUN BENCHMARK
====================
1. go to target folder (e.g for mkckks "cd mkckks")
2. run go benchmark command "go test -bench=. -benchtime=10x -timeout=0 -args -n=4" (This runs 10 repetition of benchmark for the 4 party case)
